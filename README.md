# SUSE studio ImageWriter

Fedora LiveUSB Creator is amazing, but not for everything, so I been using Unetbootin for quite a while. That was untill I dabbled with OpenSUSE. SUSE Studio Image Writer is amazing. Does what I need, in a totally integrated (not like Unetbootin), dead simple and beautifull GUI in Gnome Shell

This is what I have on my computer, where I don't know why it does not compile unlike the same files in my OBS repository.

My OpenSUSE Build Service (OBS)repository:
